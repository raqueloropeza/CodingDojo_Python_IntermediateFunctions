Practice writing functions and looping over dictionaries in Python

1.Update Values in Dictionaries and Lists

    Change the value 10 in x to 15. Once you're done, x should now be [ [5,2,3], [15,8,9] ].
  
    Change the last_name of the first student from 'Jordan' to 'Bryant'
  
    In the sports_directory, change 'Messi' to 'Andres'
  
    Change the value 20 in z to 30

2. Iterate Through a List of Dictionaries

    Create a function iterateDictionary(some_list) that, given a list of dictionaries, the function loops through each dictionary in the list and prints each key and the            associated value.
 
3.  Get Values From a List of Dictionaries

    Create a function iterateDictionary2(key_name, some_list) that, given a list of dictionaries and a key name, the function prints the value stored in that key for each           dictionary.

4. Iterate Through a Dictionary with List Values

    Create a function printInfo(some_dict) that given a dictionary whose values are all lists, prints the name of each key along with the size of its list, and then prints the     associated values within each key's list.
